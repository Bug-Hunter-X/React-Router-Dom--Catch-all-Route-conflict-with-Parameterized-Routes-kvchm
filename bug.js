```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ... other routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code will work fine in most cases. However, if you have a route that uses path parameters and has a catch-all route like `*`, the catch-all route will always match even if a more specific route exists.  For example:

```javascript
<Route path="/users/:id" element={<User />} />
<Route path="/*" element={<NotFound />} />
```
If you go to `/users/123`, the `NotFound` component will render instead of the `User` component, because `*` is a more general path. This is a subtle and easily missed error.
